# About Me
Hello! I am lily or alice

The things I favor a lot is cartoon, games, drawing and anime. I love to out on arcades or claw areas. I have 2 dogs chika and princess they are brats but sweet.
My first choice is to make commissions for people with art. I've practiced art at a very young age up to now and my love for it grew. I still need to learn how in depth I can achieve with art as well as understand how advertising shows my art. Art is something I genuinely enjoy, so to express myself as my job would be a dream. Although it is recommended to find a job to help support my commissions which is something I am willing to understand and apply to help my ideal job. 
How this job connects to my lifestyle is I want a calming life with personal happiness. With this job I can go anywhere to work like at a park, another country, in front of people or online as well. I also can have my creativity expand as people give ideas to draw for them with interpretations they might like. The salary for the job has different waves of money every day based on the commissions I take in. If I gain a second job I can help myself grow better to help get things to enjoy life to the fullest. 
This course will help me practice many things in my daily life. For example my collaboration is with the people, I will take in ideas and suggest interpretations of their ideas to help make a good art product. Time management is key as well. Depending on how long I will spend on an art piece will affect how many drawings I take in a day as well as handle. So managing will be key for my work ethic and mental capacity. My art skills will improve a lot if I practice over the year as well with my creativity thought process.
